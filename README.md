# Rosbag Labeler

This is a repository for labeling rosbags with user input. The node decodes rosbag file, plays the selected topic set(Publishes as topics) and is able to add additional topics to the bag with its related stamp. This allows for adding labeled topics to this rosbag, later to be used with algorithms to test and train models.
